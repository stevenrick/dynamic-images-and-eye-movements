##Introduction
The DIEM (Dynamic Images and Eye-Movements) Project is developing new visualisation tools for eye movements in dynamic images, as well as new data analysis tools and techniques based on dynamic regions of interest (DROIs) for use in film and video.

We are applying these new methods to investigate how people see and understand the visual world as depicted in various videos. The videos used in our experiments include advertisements, film clips, real-world scenes, social scenes, film trailers, video game trailers, music videos, documentaries, sports highlights, and news clips.

##Members
The DIEM project is led by Professor John Henderson, director of the Visual Cognition Lab at the University of Edinburgh. The DIEM Team also includes Dr. Robin Hill, Dr. Tim Smith, and Parag Mital.

###CARPE
The tool hosted here entitled, CARPE, or Computational and Algorithmic Representation and Processing of Eye-movements, allows one to begin visualizing eye-movement data in a number of ways. It currently supports low-level feature visualizations, clustering of eye-movements, model selection, heat-map visualizations, blending, contour visualizations, peek-through visualizations, movie output, binocular data input, and more.

Requirements: Windows XP or Higher; At least 1 GB RAM; 2.4 GHz+; Libraries: openFrameworks, Intel OpenCV, Quicktime, Visual Studio 2005, 2008, and Service Packs Runtimes

If you are interested in getting this working on other platforms, please get in touch with me as most of the libraries are cross-platform and code is already in place for getting it to run on OSX or Linux.

For the latest CARPE, always use the SVN located at: http://dynamic-images-and-eye-movements.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

##Funding
The DIEM Project is generously funded by the Leverhulme Trust and the Economic and Social Research Council.

The University of Edinburgh is a charitable body, registered in Scotland, with registration number SC005336.
